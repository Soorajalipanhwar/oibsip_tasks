# Task-5: SALES PREDICTION using Machine Learning
Sales forecasting is the art of estimating how much of a product consumers will purchase depending on variables like the amount of money spent on promoting your product,
the target market you target, or the platform you are using for your advertising.
A product- and service-based company often needs a data scientist to forecast future sales with each decision they make to control the price of product promotion.
We used Python to complete the machine learning objective of sales prediction in this project.
