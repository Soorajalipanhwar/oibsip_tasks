# TASK-3 CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Numerous elements, like a car's features, horoscope, mileage, and brand reputation, affect a car's price,among many others.
One of the main topics of machine learning research is the prediction of car prices.
So in this project, we have created and trained a ML model to predict the car prices based elements that affect car's price.
